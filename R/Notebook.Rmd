Load the required packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(survival)
```

Read in the mortality data from the field experiments

```{r}
survdat <- read.csv(here("Data", "MAY_SEPT_2023_MORTSBYBAG.csv"))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
